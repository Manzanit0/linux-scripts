## linux-scripts

Small repo for useful scripts I use every now and then in my day to day with Linux.

### install-default
This script has a small collection of applications I use everyday:
* Atom and some packages (linter, dockblockr, etc.)
* InteliJ IDEA
* Postman
* Spotify (How not?)
* Google Chrome
* Wmail client (https://thomas101.github.io/wmail/)
* Telegram messenger
* Slack
